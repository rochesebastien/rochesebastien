## ðŸš€ About Me
Hi! I have just finished my degree in information systems design, I have been passionate about computer development, particularly the web, since my post-baccalaureate years. Driven by creativity and curiosity, I want to become a web developer and deepen my experience in this field. That's why I continue on a full stack master web developer for the next 2 years.
